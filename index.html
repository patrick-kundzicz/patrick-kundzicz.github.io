                Built using the <b>GTZAN</b> dataset: 1000 songs categorized by genre<br>
                The dataset contains audio (22050 Hz, 16-bit, mono), spectrograms, and a set of features for each song
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Chroma STFT (Short-Time Fourier Transform) Mean</b> <br>
                - Groups the frequency range (0-11025 Hz) into 12 bins and averages the resulting value over our audio sample <br>
                - Commonly used in tools for key or harmonic detection of a song <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>RMS (Root Mean-Square) Loudness</b><br>
                - Measures the average amplitude of an audio sample <br>
                - Gives an idea of (perceived) loudness and is a commonly-used metric when mixing and mastering of a song <br>
                to make sure the dynamic/transient content is in-line with other tracks in the genre

                <b>Guided exploration: How are RMS, Chroma STFT, and Spectrogram visualizations relevant to music production</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Click on a datapoint with a high RMS Mean value and a low Chroma STFT Mean.</b> <br>
                - In the spectrogram, there are generally more bright regions for longer time periods <br>
                - The spectrogram will also generally have more high frequencies if we compare to a low RMS Mean datapoint <br>
                - Filling out the entire frequency spectrum with more content can lend itself to creating a louder track (although not a strict rule)
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Click on a datapoint with a low RMS Mean value and a high Chroma STFT Mean.</b> <br>
                - Many songs are constructed using scales built on 12 degrees <br>
                - Each scale degree across the different octaves and its overtones can be converted to a corresponding frequency <br>
                - Because of this relationship, we can average out the frequency content of a song into a single value, and understand the general harmonic content <br>
                - The samples chosen for "disco" have a higher variance in chroma than rock, which suggests that the harmonic content of the disco tracks are more varied <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Why is this important to understand for people involved in the engineering of music</b><br>
                - Generally, when music is made, we draw on references from our previous listening and try to create something new <br>
                - When working on a song that falls under the umbrella of "metal", a producer will want the loudness and dynamic/transient content of that track to stand up to other metal tracks <br>
                - The same producer working on a "classical" track would likely want that mix to stand up to other "classical" tracks, requiring a different set of references <br>
                - Being mindful of common characteristics (like RMS loudness) in the genres you pull from are important to creating songs that stand up when played next to others in the genre <br>
